# aLODmanuzio

A Linked Open Data project on the first editor in history, Aldo Manuzio. In 1494 he founded the Aldine Press in Venice, the perfect cradle for his “book revolution”: as a Republic, Venice didn’t have the strong oppression of the censorship or of a noble government. The project describes cultural heritage artworks, texts and multimedia, with the aim to conceptualize Manuzio's figure in the history of printing.
